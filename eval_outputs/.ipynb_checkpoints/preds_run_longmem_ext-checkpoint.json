For example, if the tires are worn out or underinflated, it can cause the bike to feel sluggish and less responsive, making it harder to maneuver and maintain balance. On the other hand, if the tires are in good condition, they will provide better traction, grip, and stability, which can enhance the riding experience.\n- **Maintenance:** Regular maintenance, such as checking for any flat spots, punctures, or other issues, can prevent unexpected problems and ensure the bike is in optimal working condition.
