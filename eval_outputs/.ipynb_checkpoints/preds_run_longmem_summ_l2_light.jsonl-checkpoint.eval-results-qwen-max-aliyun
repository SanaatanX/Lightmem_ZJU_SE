It can work well with both more or less water than other types, but generally, using slightly more water can enhance the extraction process, leading to a richer, fuller body and stronger flavor.\n   \n   - Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Gesha, and Guatemalan Antigua coffees: These coffees have a complex flavor profile that can benefit from a moderate amount of water. They can handle either more or less water, but using slightly more water can help bring out their unique characteristics without making them too bitter or watery.\n\n2. **Water-to-Coffee Ratio:**\n   - For a French press, a common rule of thumb is to use 10-15 grams of coffee per tablespoon of coffee. This ratio helps to extract the right balance of flavors and oils from the coffee grounds.\n   - However, the optimal ratio can vary based", "autoeval_label": {"model": "qwen-plus", "label": false}}
