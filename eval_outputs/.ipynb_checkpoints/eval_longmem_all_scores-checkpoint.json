\"hypothesis\": \"The user's previous 5K run time was 24 minutes. To determine the user's previous 5K run time, we need to understand that they expressed an interest in a 10K run. \\n\\nGiven the user's statement that they are interested in a 10K run, which indicates a preference for a longer distance than a 5K run. Since the user mentioned a 10K run, it's likely that the user is more inclined towards a longer distance. Therefore, the user's previous 5K run time would be shorter than 24 minutes. \\n\\nTo summarize the user's previous 5K run time, we can compare it with the 10K run time of 10K. If the user's 5K run was faster than 10K, then the 5K run time would be less than 10K. Given the user's statement that they are interested in a 10K run, it's reasonable to assume that the user's 5K run was slower than 10K.

This means you can quickly narrow down your results based on specific criteria.\\n\\n   - For example, if you want to find all the Marvel movies, you can filter by the \\\"Franchise/Series\\\" column.\\n   - If you want to find all the movies from a certain year, you can filter by the \\\"Release Year\\\" column.\\n\\n2. **Sort Data:** Sorting your data can help you quickly find what you're looking for.\\n\\n   - Sort by any column header (e.g., \\\"Movie Title\\\", \\\"Release Year\\\", etc.) to arrange your movies in alphabetical order, chronological order, or by any other criterion.\\n\\n3. **Use Conditional Formatting:** This feature highlights cells based on specific conditions.\\n\\n   - For example, you could highlight all the movies you've re-watched\",\n    \"autoeval_label\": false\n}\n{\n    \"question\": \"How many plants did I acquire in the last month?\",\n    \"answer\": 3,\n    \"hypothesis\": \" avoid over-fertilizing.\\\\n3. **Frequency:** The frequency of fertilization depends on the type of fertilizer and the growth stage of your plant. For peace lilies, a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20) can be used every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).\\\\n4. **Alternative options:** If you're unsure about the fertilizer type or concentration, you can opt for a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) instead. This is a safe option that won't harm your peace lily.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, using a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) at a diluted concentration every 4-6 weeks during the growing season is a good practice for your peace lily. If you're still unsure, you can always ask the nursery staff for advice.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, consistency is key in plant care.

The assessed value is usually a percentage of the property's market value, often between 5% and 10%. For example, if the property's market value is $200,000, the assessed value would be around $20,000 to $20,000.

Finding cost-effective solutions is a significant challenge.\\\\n3. **Teacher Training**: Teachers need to be trained to effectively integrate AI-based tools into their teaching practices. Providing adequate training and support is essential for successful implementation.\\\\n4. **Equity and Access**: Not all students have equal access to technology and internet connectivity, which can create disparities in learning opportunities. Addressing these equity issues is critical.\\\\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: There are ethical considerations related to the use of AI in education, such as bias in algorithms and the potential for AI to replace human teachers.

It's available for FHA-insured loans, which require a minimum down payment of 3.5%. The cost of MP is typically lower than PMI, but it's mandatory for FHA loans.\\\\n\\\\nIn your case, since you're using a conventional loan, PMI is likely the type you'll encounter. However, if you decide to put down a larger down payment, you might be able to avoid PMI altogether.\\\\n\\\\nIt's important to note that PMI premiums are typically paid monthly and are included in your monthly mortgage payment. If you choose to pay them upfront, you'll receive a tax deduction for the first 12 months, but the tax benefits are limited.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, once you've made 20% of the home's value in payments, you can request to have PMI removed from your loan.
