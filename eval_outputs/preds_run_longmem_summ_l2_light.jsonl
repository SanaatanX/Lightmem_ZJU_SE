{"question_id": "2a1811e2", "hypothesis": "To determine how many days passed between the Hindu festival of Holi (also known as Holi) and the Sunday mass at St. Mary's Church, we need to consider the typical duration of Holi and the timing of the church service.\n\nHoli, also known as the Festival of Colors or the Festival of Colors, is celebrated by Hindus as a major Hindu festival that typically lasts for two days. It usually begins on the 13th day after the full moon in the month of Phalguna (February or March according to the Gregorian calendar) and continues for two days. \n\nThe exact date can vary each year but generally falls between February 20 and April 14. \n\nThe mass at St. Mary's Church is held on a Sunday, which is a weekly religious service. Assuming the church holds one Sunday per week, there would be approximately 2 * 7 = 14 Sundays in a 28-30 day month, and 13 Sundays in a 29-day month. \n\nGiven that Holi typically occurs over two days, it will likely span across two weeks. If the mass at St. Mary's Church is held on a Sunday within this period, it would be possible that it could fall on"}

If you want the ribs to be extra juicy and flavorful, marinating them for 12-24 hours would be ideal. \n\nHowever, if Alex prefers a shorter marination time, it's perfectly fine too.

{"question_id": "2311e44b", "hypothesis": "Based on the information given, it seems there might be some confusion. The user was talking about reading 50 books by the end of the year, not specifically about a book called \"The Nightingale\". There's no mention of a book named \"The Nightingale\" or any specific reading goal related to it. \n\nHowever, if we focus on the context provided, the user mentioned plans to read 50 books by the end of the year, having already read 12 books, and aiming to read 38 books in the remaining 4 months. This would mean they aim to read an average of 9.5 books per month (38 books / 4 months). \n\nSo, if \"The Nightingale\" is indeed one of the books they plan to read, then you would have 38 - 12 = 26 pages left to read from \"The Nightingale\".

{"question_id": "bb7c3b45", "hypothesis": "It seems there was some confusion in the original conversation. The user mentioned purchasing a pair of Jimmy Choo heels for $200, but this price was not part of any other context or question. Therefore, the question \"How much did I save on the Jimmy Choo heels?\" cannot be answered with the information given, as no comparison or discount was mentioned. If you purchased the heels for $200, then you did not save money since you paid the full price. To determine if you saved money, we would need to know the cost of the heels before purchase or the discount applied."}

{"question_id": "09ba9854", "hypothesis": "To determine how much you can save by taking the train from Narita International Airport to your hotel compared to taking a taxi, we need to compare the costs of the two suggested train options.\n\nThe two train options are:\n1.
