At its peak, the Taliban government controlled approximately 90% of the country, while remaining regions in the northeast were held by the Northern Alliance, which maintained broad international recognition as a continuation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan.After the September 11 attacks and subsequent declaration of a \"War on Terror\" by the United States, international opposition to the regime drastically increased, with diplomatic recognition from the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan being rescinded. The Islamic Emirate ceased to exist on 7 December 2001 after being overthrown by the Northern Alliance, which had been bolstered by the ISAF coalition established after a U.S.-led invasion of the country two months prior. The Taliban continued to refer to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in official communications when it was out of power from 2001 to 2021.",

The Talmud deduces that it was built into the north wall of the Temple in Jerusalem, half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access both to the temple and to the outside. The chamber is said to have resembled a basilica in appearance, having two entrances: one in the east and one in the west. The name presumably arises to distinguish it from the buildings in the temple complex used for ritual purposes, which had to be constructed of unhewn stones. (The Torah prohibits the use of hewn stones or those touched by iron for the altar per Ex 20:22, Deut 27:6.\tThe Sanhedrin (Hebrew and Aramaic: סַנְהֶדְרִין; Greek: Συνέδριον, synedrion, 'sitting together,' hence 'assembly' or 'council') was an assembly of either 23 or 71 elders (known as \"rabbis\" after the destruction of the Second Temple), appointed to sit as a tribunal in every city in the ancient Land of Israel. There were two classes of Rabbinite Jewish courts which were called Sanhedrin, the Great Sanhedrin and the Lesser Sanhedrin. A lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges was appointed to sit as a tribunal in each city, but there was only supposed to be one Great Sanhedrin of 71 judges, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases which were decided by lesser courts. In general usage, the Sanhedrin without qualifier normally refers to the Great Sanhedrin, which was presided over by the Nasi, who functioned as its head or representing president, and was a member of the court; the Av Beit Din or the chief of the court, who was second to the nasi; and 69 general members. In the Second Temple period, the Great Sanhedrin met in the Temple in Jerusalem, in a building called the Hall of Hewn Stones.",

During his playing career, Allegri played in the Serie A as a midfielder with Pisa, Pescara, Cagliari, Perugia and Napoli. In 2002, he won the Serie D title with Aglianese, with whom he retired as a player. During his time in Livorno, due to his lean body and quickness, he was referred to as “Acciughina” (Little Anchovy), a nickname Italian press still uses to address him.After beginning his managerial career in 2003 with several smaller Italian sides, Allegri helped Sassuolo gain promotion to the Serie B for the first time in their history, winning the Serie C1 championship and Super Cup in the same year. From 2008 to 2010, he coached Cagliari in Serie A, leading them to their best Serie A finish in almost 15 years.\tJuventus FC FCntus Football Club (from Latin: iuventūs, Italian pronunciation: [juˈvɛntus], 'youth'), colloquially known as Juventus FC FC (pronounced [ˈjuːve]), is a professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, Italy, that competes in the Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus FC FCntus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 14 Coppa Italia titles and nine Supercoppa Italiana titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus FC FCntus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.",

Koeman was capable of playing both as a defender and as a midfielder; he frequently played as a sweeper, although he was equally known for his goalscoring, long-range shooting, and accuracy from free kicks and penalties. Because of his goalscoring, he is considered one of the best attacking center backs of all time.Born in Zaandam, Koeman began his career at Groningen before transferring to the Netherlands' most successful club Ajax in 1983, where they won the national Eredivisie title in 1984–85. He then joined Ajax's rivals PSV in 1986, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles (1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89) and the European Cup in 1988.\tThe Netherlands national association football team (Dutch: Netherlands national association football team or simply Het Nederlands elftal) has represented the Netherlands in international men's football matches since 1905. The men's national team is controlled by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the governing body for football in the Netherlands, which is a part of UEFA, under the jurisdiction of FIFA. They were sometimes regarded as the greatest national team of the respective generations. Most of the Netherlands home matches are played at the Johan Cruyff Arena, De Kuip, Philips Stadion and De Grolsch Veste. The team is colloquially referred to as Het Nederlands Elftal (The Dutch Eleven) or Netherlands national association football team, after the House of Orange-Nassau and their distinctive orange jerseys.",

The club was founded on 25 May 1926 as UD (Uzinele și Domeniile) Reșița and throughout its almost centennial history survived to many sharp ups and downs, from a national title in 1931 and a silver medal in 1932 to the last shine in the late 1990s, several reorganizations in the 2000s and an almost fatal fall at the level of amateur leagues during the 2010s. Over time CSM had important battles with local rivals as Muncitorul Reșița or Gloria Reșița, but has secured itself the city's supremacy, as well as the title of county's most important and supported club. Despite the strong support from the Mountain Banat, Reșițenii have never succeeded in imposing themselves on a regional level, not even the national title won in 1931 or the 1954 cup not being able to tilt the balance in favor of \"the red and blacks\", in their duel for Banat against FC Politehnica Timișoara. In time the rivalry between the two sides increased as intensity and continued even after the bankruptcy of FC Politehnica, but now at a much lower level, against ASU Politehnica Timișoara, fans team and unofficial successor of the old white and violet side.",

Over time CSM had important battles with local rivals as Muncitorul Reșița or Gloria Reșița, but has secured itself the city's supremacy, as well as the title of county's most important and supported club. Despite the strong support from the Mountain Banat, Reșițenii have never succeeded in imposing themselves on a regional level, not even the national title won in 1931 or the 1954 cup not being able to tilt the balance in favor of \"the red and blacks\", in their duel for Banat against FC Politehnica Timișoara.

It has spent its entire history in the top flight of the Romanian league system, the Liga I. The original FCSB București football team was founded in 1947 and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence, through the namesake CSA FCSB București sports club. In 1998, the football department and its facilities were separated from the latter and taken over by a group of shareholders in a post-Ceaușescu privatisation scheme, allegedly leading to one of the shareholders acquiring full ownership five years later. However, CSA FCSB București has been in conflict with the football club since 2011, claiming that it was a new and separate entity; this resulted in multiple court cases and the forced change of the name from\nFC FCSB București to  FC FCSB in early 2017.Domestically, when taken together with the disputed pre-2003 honours, the club has won the Liga I 26 times, Cupa României 24 times, Cupa Ligii two times, and Supercupa României six times—all competition records.\tAndrea Compagno (born 22 April 1996) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Liga I club FCSB.",

Domestically, UTA is one of the most successful Romanian sides of the 20th century, sharing with Chinezul Timișoara the record for the most title wins outside Bucharest, earning it the nickname Campioana Provinciei (\"Provincial Champion\"), which it lost at the conclusion of the 2020–21 season when newcomer CFR Cluj claimed its seventh Liga I trophy. FC UTA Arad's decline started with a transfer to the second division in 1979, and it appeared in the top flight before being dissolved in 2014. FC UTA Arad was eventually promoted from the Liga IV and managed to return to the Liga I in 2021.\tClaudiu Keșerü (Romanian pronunciation: [klaˈudju anˈdrej keˈʃery]; born 2 December 1986) is a former Romanian professional footballer who played mainly as a striker. After starting out at his hometown side FC Oradea, Keșerü soon moved to Nantes in 2003. Over the course of nearly eleven years in France, he represented five clubs and amassed Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 totals of 240 appearances and 67 goals. In 2014, he returned to his native country by signing a contract with defending champions Steaua București. Keșerü also had a brief spell with Al-Gharafa in Qatar, before moving to Ludogorets Razgrad in the summer of 2015.",

Burns retired from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2014 after a 32-year diplomatic career. From 2014 to 2021, he served as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Burns served as ambassador to Jordan from 1998 to 2001, assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs from 2001 to 2005, ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 and under secretary of state for political affairs from 2008 to 2011.In January 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Burns to become CIA director.

As a principal member of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the Central Intelligence Agency reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States. Following the dissolution of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) at the end of World War II, President Harry S. Truman created the Central Intelligence Group under the direction of a Director of Central Intelligence by presidential directive on January 22, 1946, and this group was transformed into the Central Intelligence Agency by implementation of the National Security Act of 1947. Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is a domestic security service, the Central Intelligence Agency has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. The Central Intelligence Agency serves as the national manager for HUMINT, coordinating activities across the IC.",

The party's original goal was to oppose the license fees for the national broadcasting organization NHK, revising the 1950 Broadcasting Law to scramble NHK's broadcast signal, which would mean that only those who watch NHK pay for it. The party's policies has since expanded to cover other issues, including lower taxes, increasing military defense capability, and reaching energy independence through nuclear energy.The party has been referred to by some commentators and political scientists as a fringe or joke party, despite having seen occasional success in national elections. Its candidates and officeholders, who are often YouTubers or other Internet celebrities, have been frequent sources of controversy.",

He served as a legislator in the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2010, and as Mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, prior to taking office as premier of Taiwan.On 24 November 2018, he announced his intention to resign from the premiership after the Democratic Progressive Party suffered a major defeat in local elections, and left office on 14 January 2019 after the swearing-in of his successor Su Tseng-chang. Lai mounted a challenge against Tsai in the 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and after defeat, served as the running mate of President Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 Taiwan presidential election in which the tandem was victorious. In April 2023, Lai was nominated by the DPP as their presidential candidate for the 2024 Taiwan presidential election.\tThe Democratic Progressive Party (Democratic Progressive Party) is a Taiwanese nationalist and centre-left political party in the Republic of China (Taiwan). Currently controlling both the Republic of China presidency and the unicameral Legislative Yuan, it is the majority ruling party and the dominant party in the Pan-Green Coalition as of 2023. Founded in 1986 by Hsu Hsin-liang, Hsieh Tsung-min and Lin Shui-chuan, a year prior to the end of martial law, the Democratic Progressive Party is one of two major parties in Taiwan, the other being the historically dominant Kuomintang (KMT), which previously ruled the country as a one-party state. It has traditionally been associated with a strong advocacy of human rights, emerging against the authoritarian White Terror that was initiated by the KMT, as well as the promotion of Taiwanese nationalism and identity. Tsai Ing-wen, who is a three-time chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party, serves as the incumbent President and the second member of the Democratic Progressive Party to hold the presidency.The Democratic Progressive Party is a longtime member of Liberal International and a founding member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats.",
